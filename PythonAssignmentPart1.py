____________________________________________ANSWER of PythonAssignment 1_____________________________________________________

Q1. Python is considered a general-purpose programming language because it can be used to develop a wide range of applications and solutions. It is not limited to a specific domain or purpose. Python is also considered a high-level programming language because it provides abstraction and a simplified syntax that is closer to human-readable language, making it easier to write and understand code.

Q2. Python is called a dynamically typed language because the type of a variable is determined during runtime, rather than at compile-time. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. You can assign any value to a variable, and its type is inferred based on the value assigned to it. The type of a variable can change dynamically by assigning a value of a different type to it.

Q3. Pros of Python:
- Easy to learn and read: Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it beginner-friendly and conducive to code readability.
- Versatile and powerful: Python has a vast standard library and a large ecosystem of third-party packages, providing a wide range of functionalities for various applications.
- Cross-platform compatibility: Python code can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Productivity and efficiency: Python's concise syntax and built-in features help developers write code faster and more efficiently.
- Integration capabilities: Python can be easily integrated with other languages such as C, C++, and Java, allowing for code reuse and extension.
- Large community support: Python has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources, documentation, and community support available.

Cons of Python:
- Performance: Compared to lower-level languages like C and C++, Python can be slower in terms of execution speed and memory usage.
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Python's Global Interpreter Lock can limit the performance of multithreaded programs by allowing only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.
- Mobile and game development: While Python can be used for mobile app and game development, it may not be as popular or performant as languages specifically designed for these domains.

Q4. Python can be used in various domains, including:
- Web development: Python's frameworks like Django and Flask are widely used for developing web applications.
- Data analysis and scientific computing: Python has libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy that are popular for data manipulation, analysis, and scientific computing.
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence: Python has libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn that are widely used for machine learning and AI applications.
- Automation and scripting: Python's simplicity and readability make it a popular choice for automating tasks and writing scripts.
- Desktop GUI applications: Python provides libraries like Tkinter and PyQt for developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) for desktop applications.
- Network programming: Python's built-in libraries, such as socket and requests, make it suitable for network programming and working with protocols like HTTP and TCP/IP.

Q5. In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory. You can declare a variable by assigning a value to it using the assignment operator (`=`). Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to specify the type of the variable explicitly.

Example of variable declaration:
```python
x = 10  # x is a variable with an integer value of 10
name = "John"  # name is a variable with a string value of "John"
```

Q6. You can take input from the user in Python using the `input()` function. It reads a line of input from the user as a string.

Example:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

Q7. The default data type

 of the value returned by the `input()` function is a string. Even if the user enters a number, it is treated as a string. If you want to use the input value as a different data type, you need to explicitly convert it using type casting.

Q8. Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. Python provides built-in functions to perform type casting, such as `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.

Example of type casting:
```python
num_str = input("Enter a number: ")
num = int(num_str)  # Convert the input string to an integer
result = num + 10
print(result)
```

Q9. No, you cannot take more than one input from the user using a single `input()` function call. The `input()` function reads a single line of input as a string. If you want to take multiple inputs, you need to call the `input()` function multiple times.

Example:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
```

Q10. Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and predefined functionalities. These keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

Examples of keywords in Python: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `return`, `True`, `False`, `None`, etc.

Q11. No, keywords cannot be used as variable names. Python reserves keywords for specific purposes, and using them as variable names would lead to syntax errors. For example, you cannot declare a variable with the name `if`, `for`, or `while` because these are keywords used for control flow statements.

Q12. Indentation in Python refers to the whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of a line of code. It is used to define the block or scope of code in Python. Indentation is a syntactical requirement in Python and serves the purpose of grouping statements. It indicates which statements belong to a specific block, such as the body of a loop or a function definition.

The use of indentation in Python is crucial because it determines the structure and execution flow of the code. Incorrect indentation can result in syntax errors or unexpected program behavior.

Example:
```python
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
    print("This statement is inside the if block")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
    print("This statement is inside the else block")
```

Q13. In Python, you can output information to the console using the `print()` function. The `print()` function takes one or more arguments and displays them as output on the console.

Example:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Q14. Operators in Python are special symbols or characters that perform specific operations on operands (variables, values). Python supports various types of operators, including arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`), assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), and more.

Q15. In Python, the `/` operator performs float division, returning the quotient as a floating-point number. The `//` operator performs integer division, returning the quotient as an integer without the decimal part.

Example:
```pythonCertainly! Here are the responses to the remaining questions:

Q16. In Python, the modulo operator `%` is used to find the remainder of a division operation.

Example:
```python
print(10 % 3)   # Output: 1
```

Q17. Python provides several methods for string manipulation. Some commonly used string methods include:
- `lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase.
- `upper()`: Converts the string to uppercase.
- `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the string.
- `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
- `join()`: Joins a list of strings into a single string using a specified delimiter.
- `replace()`: Replaces occurrences of a substring with another substring.
- `find()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring within the string.
- `startswith()`: Checks if the string starts with a specified substring.
- `endswith()`: Checks if the string ends with a specified substring.

Example:
```python
text = "Hello, World!"

print(text.lower())              # Output: hello, world!
print(text.upper())              # Output: HELLO, WORLD!
print(text.strip())              # Output: Hello, World! (no leading/trailing whitespace)
print(text.split(", "))          # Output: ['Hello', 'World!']
print("-".join(['Hello', 'World!']))   # Output: Hello-World!
print(text.replace("Hello", "Hi"))    # Output: Hi, World!
print(text.find("World"))         # Output: 7
print(text.startswith("Hello"))   # Output: True
print(text.endswith("!"))         # Output: True
```

Q18. A list in Python is a collection of items enclosed in square brackets (`[]`). It can contain elements of different data types, including integers, strings, booleans, or even other lists. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after they are created.

Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

print(fruits)            # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
print(len(fruits))       # Output: 3 (length of the list)
print(fruits[0])         # Output: apple (accessing the first element)
fruits.append("grape")   # Add an element to the end of the list
print(fruits)            # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']
fruits.remove("banana")  # Remove a specific element from the list
print(fruits)            # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'grape']
```

Q19. A tuple in Python is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning its elements cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are defined by enclosing items in parentheses `()` or simply using commas without parentheses. Tuples can contain elements of different data types.

Example:
```python
person = ("John", 25, "USA")

print(person)          # Output: ('John', 25, 'USA')
print(len(person))     # Output: 3 (length of the tuple)
print(person[0])       # Output: John (accessing the first element)
name, age, country = person  # Unpacking the tuple into variables
print(name)            # Output: John
print(age)             # Output: 25
```

Q20. A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Each key is unique within the dictionary, and it is associated with a corresponding value. Dictionaries are mutable and can contain elements of different data types
print(10 / 3)   # Output: 3.

Q21. In Python, loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements or execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two main types of loops in Python:
- `for` loop: It is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects. It executes a block of code for each element in the sequence.
- `while` loop: It is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

Q22. The `for` loop is typically used when you know the number of iterations in advance, whereas the `while` loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is no longer true.

Q23. The `continue` statement is used inside a loop to skip the remaining code within the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. It is often used in conjunction with conditional statements to selectively skip certain iterations based on a specific condition.

Q24. The `break` statement is used inside a loop to exit the loop prematurely. When encountered, it immediately terminates the loop and continues with the next statement after the loop, skipping any remaining iterations.

Q25. The `pass` statement is a null statement in Python. It is used as a placeholder when a statement is syntactically required, but you don't want to perform any action. It allows you to write empty code blocks without causing any syntax errors.

Q26. The `range()` function in Python is used to generate a sequence of numbers. It can be used in combination with a `for` loop to iterate over a specific range of numbers.

Example:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)   # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)   # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)   # Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

Q27. A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It allows you to organize your code into logical and modular components. Functions help in code reusability, readability, and maintainability.

Example:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, Python!")

greet()   # Output: Hello, Python!

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(2, 3)
print(result)   # Output: 5
```

Q28. A module in Python is a file containing Python code that defines variables, functions, and classes. It allows you to logically organize related code into separate files and reuse them in other programs by importing the module.

Example:
```python
# mymodule.py
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# main.py
import mymodule

mymodule.greet("Python")   # Output: Hello, Python!
```

Q29. A package in Python is a way to organize related modules into a directory hierarchy. It allows you to create a hierarchical structure of modules and sub-packages, making it easier to manage and reuse code.

Example:
```
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
    subpackage/
        __init__.py
        module3.py
```

Q30. The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules and packages that provide a wide range of functionality. It includes modules for file I/O, networking

Q30. The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules and packages that provide a wide range of functionality. It includes modules for file I/O, networking, regular expressions, mathematical operations, data compression, multi-threading, and much more. These modules are available for use in your Python programs without the need for external installations.

Q31. Python libraries are collections of modules that provide additional functionality beyond what is available in the Python Standard Library. Libraries are typically developed by third-party developers and can be installed using package managers such as pip. Examples of popular Python libraries include NumPy for numerical computing, pandas for data analysis, Matplotlib for data visualization, and TensorFlow for machine learning.

Q32. Python frameworks are pre-built structures that provide a foundation for developing applications. Frameworks offer a set of tools, libraries, and conventions that streamline the development process and provide ready-made solutions for common tasks. Examples of Python frameworks include Django for web development, Flask for web applications, and PyTorch for deep learning.

Q33. Python IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are software applications that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and executing Python code. IDEs often include features such as code editors with syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging tools, and project management capabilities. Popular Python IDEs include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code (with Python extensions), and Jupyter Notebook.

Certainly! Here are the responses to the remaining questions:

Q36. Variables in Python are used to store and manipulate data. To declare a variable, you simply assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=). Here's an example:

```python
x = 10
```

In the above code, the variable `x` is declared and assigned a value of `10`. Python is a dynamically typed language, so you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The type of the variable is inferred based on the value assigned to it.

Q37. You can take input from the user in Python using the `input()` function. It allows you to prompt the user for input and returns the entered value as a string. Here's an example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

In the above code, the `input()` function is used to prompt the user to enter their name. The entered value is stored in the variable `name`. The `print()` function is then used to display a greeting message using the entered name.

Q38. The default datatype of the value returned by the `input()` function is a string. Regardless of the type of the entered value, it is always treated as a string. If you want to use the input value as a different datatype, such as an integer or a float, you need to explicitly convert it using type casting.

Q39. Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one datatype to another. In Python, you can perform type casting using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc. Here's an example:

```python
x = input("Enter a number: ")  # input value is a string
x = int(x)  # converting the input value to an integer
print("The double of the number is: " + str(2 * x))
```

In the above code, the `input()` function is used to get a number from the user, which is initially a string. To perform arithmetic operations on the input value, it is converted to an integer using the `int()` function. The result of the calculation is then converted back to a string using the `str()` function for concatenation with the print statement.

Q40. No, you cannot take multiple inputs from the user using a single `input()` function. The `input()` function is designed to accept a single input at a time. If you want to take multiple inputs, you need to use the `input()` function multiple times, each time prompting the user for a different value.

Q41. Keywords, also known as reserved words, are predefined words in a programming language that have special meanings and purposes. These words are reserved and cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. In Python, keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of the language and are essential for creating meaningful code. Examples of Python keywords include `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `return`, and `print`.

Q42. No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Since keywords have predefined meanings and purposes in the language, using them as variable names would lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior. It is best to choose variable names that are descriptive and meaningful while avoiding Python keywords.

Q43. Indentation in Python refers to the whitespace at the beginning of a line of code. It is used to indicate the grouping and nesting of statements. Python uses indentation as a structural element instead of braces or other delimiters like in many other programming languages.

Q43. Indentation in Python refers to the whitespace at the beginning of a line of code. It is used to indicate the grouping and nesting of statements. Python uses indentation as a structural element instead of braces or other delimiters like in many other programming languages. The level of indentation determines the blocks of code that belong together, such as the body of a function or a loop. It is important to maintain consistent indentation to ensure that the code is properly structured and executed.

Q44. In Python, you can print output using the `print()` function. The `print()` function takes one or more arguments and displays them on the standard output. Here's an example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

The above code will print "Hello, World!" to the console.

Q45. Operators in Python are symbols or special characters that perform operations on operands. Python supports various types of operators, including arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`), assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), and more.

Q46. The `/` operator performs normal division in Python, while the `//` operator performs floor division. The `/` operator returns the quotient as a float, whereas the `//` operator returns the quotient as an integer by rounding down the result. Here's an example:

```python
a = 7 / 2
b = 7 // 2

print(a)  # Output: 3.5
print(b)  # Output: 3
```

Q47. Here's the code to achieve the desired output:

```python
string = "iNeuron"
output = ""

for i in range(5):
    output += string

print(output)
```

The output will be: "iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron"

Q48. Here's the code to take a number as input from the user and check if it's odd or even:

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
```

Q49. Boolean operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (`True` and `False`). The three main boolean operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`. 

- The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.
- The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.
- The `not` operator returns the opposite of the Boolean value of the operand.

Q50. The output of the following expressions will be:

- `1 or 0`: 1
- `0 and 0`: 0
- `True and False and True`: False
- `1 or 0 or 0`: 1

Q51. Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. The main conditional statements in Python are `if`, `elif` (short for "else if"), and `else`. They allow you to control the flow of the program based on the evaluation of certain conditions.

Q52. The `if` keyword is used to specify a block of code that should be executed if a certain condition is true. The `elif` keyword is used to
Certainly! Here are the responses to the remaining questions:

Q52. The `if` keyword is used to specify a block of code that should be executed if a certain condition is true. The `elif` keyword is used to specify additional conditions to be checked if the previous `if` or `elif` conditions are false. Finally, the `else` keyword is used to specify a block of code that should be executed if none of the previous conditions are true. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
else:
    print("x is zero")
```

In the above code, the condition `x > 0` is checked first. If it is true, the corresponding block of code under the `if` statement is executed. If it is false, the program moves to the next `elif` condition, `x < 0`, and checks if it is true. If it is true, the corresponding block of code under the `elif` statement is executed. If it is false as well, the program executes the block of code under the `else` statement.

Q53. The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects. It allows you to perform a set of statements repeatedly for each item in the sequence. Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

In the above code, the `for` loop iterates over each item in the `fruits` list and assigns it to the variable `fruit`. The indented block of code under the `for` statement is executed for each iteration, printing each fruit on a separate line.

Q54. The `range()` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range. It is commonly used in `for` loops to control the number of iterations. The `range()` function can take up to three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. Here's an example:

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

In the above code, `range(1, 10, 2)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 (inclusive) and ending at 10 (exclusive) with a step of 2. The `for` loop iterates over each number in the sequence, and the value of `i` is printed in each iteration. The output will be:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

Q55. A list comprehension in Python is a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterables. It allows you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in the original list. List comprehensions are written inside square brackets `[]` and consist of an expression followed by a `for` clause. Here's an example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)
```

In the above code, the list comprehension `x**2 for x in numbers` generates a new list `squared_numbers` by squaring each number in the `numbers` list. The output will be:

```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Q56. A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It allows you to break down your program into smaller
Certainly! Here are the responses to the remaining questions:

Q56. A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It allows you to break down your program into smaller, manageable pieces, and helps in organizing and reusing code. Functions can take input parameters (arguments), perform operations, and optionally return a result. Here's an example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
greet("Alice")
```

In the above code, we define a function called `greet` that takes a `name` parameter. When the function is called with an argument `"Alice"`, it prints "Hello, Alice!" to the console. Functions are called by their name followed by parentheses `()`, and any required arguments are passed inside the parentheses.

Q57. Yes, functions can return a value in Python using the `return` statement. The `return` statement is used to specify the value that the function should return. Here's an example:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
    
result = add(3, 4)
print(result)
```

In the above code, the `add` function takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their sum using the `return` statement. When the function is called with arguments `3` and `4`, the result is returned and stored in the `result` variable. Finally, the value of `result` is printed, which will be `7`.

Q58. Yes, a function can have multiple return statements. The `return` statement is used to immediately exit the function and return a value. When a `return` statement is encountered, the function execution is terminated, and the specified value is returned. Here's an example:

```python
def get_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "D"
    
grade = get_grade(85)
print(grade)
```

In the above code, the `get_grade` function takes a `score` parameter and returns the corresponding grade based on the score. The function has multiple return statements, each returning a different grade. When the function is called with a score of `85`, it returns `"B"`, which is then stored in the `grade` variable and printed.

Q59. The difference between the `print()` function and returning a value is that `print()` is used to display information on the console, whereas returning a value allows you to pass the result of a function back to the calling code. 

- The `print()` function is used for output purposes and displays information on the console. It is useful for debugging, providing feedback to the user, or printing intermediate results. However, `print()` does not provide a way to reuse the printed value in further computations within the program.

- Returning a value, on the other hand, allows you to pass a result from a function back to the calling code. By using the `return` statement, you can make the result available for assignment to a variable or use it as input for another function. Returning a value allows for more flexibility in manipulating and reusing data within a program.

Q60. A module in Python is a file containing Python code, typically with a `.py` extension, that defines functions, classes, and variables. Modules allow you to organize related code into separate files and provide a way to reuse code across different programs. You can use the functions, classes, and variables defined in a module by importing the module into your code. Python provides a wide range of built-in modules,


Certainly! Here are the responses to the remaining questions:

Q60. A module in Python is a file containing Python code, typically with a `.py` extension, that defines functions, classes, and variables. Modules allow you to organize related code into separate files and provide a way to reuse code across different programs. You can use the functions, classes, and variables defined in a module by importing the module into your code. Python provides a wide range of built-in modules, such as `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `os`, and many more. Additionally, you can create your own modules to encapsulate reusable code.

Q61. To import a module in Python, you can use the `import` statement followed by the name of the module. Here's an example:

```python
import math

result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)
```

In the above code, the `math` module is imported using the `import` statement. The `sqrt()` function from the `math` module is then used to calculate the square root of `16`, and the result is printed.

Q62. You can import specific items from a module using the `from` keyword. This allows you to use the imported items directly without referencing the module name. Here's an example:

```python
from math import sqrt

result = sqrt(16)
print(result)
```

In the above code, only the `sqrt()` function is imported from the `math` module using the `from` keyword. Now, you can directly use `sqrt()` without referencing `math`.

Q63. Yes, you can give an imported module or function a different name using the `as` keyword. This is known as aliasing. It can be useful when working with modules with long names or to avoid naming conflicts. Here's an example:

```python
import math as m

result = m.sqrt(16)
print(result)
```

In the above code, the `math` module is imported and assigned an alias `m` using the `as` keyword. Now, you can use `m` instead of `math` to access the functions and attributes of the module.

Q64. The `datetime` module in Python provides classes for working with dates, times, and time intervals. To get the current date and time, you can use the `datetime` class and its `now()` method. Here's an example:

```python
from datetime import datetime

current_datetime = datetime.now()
print(current_datetime)
```

In the above code, the `datetime` class is imported from the `datetime` module. The `now()` method is called on the `datetime` class to get the current date and time. The result is stored in the `current_datetime` variable and printed.

Q65. Yes, you can format the output of the `datetime` object using the `strftime()` method. The `strftime()` method allows you to specify a format string that defines how the date and time should be formatted. Here's an example:

```python
from datetime import datetime

current_datetime = datetime.now()
formatted_datetime = current_datetime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(formatted_datetime)
```

In the above code, the `strftime()` method is called on the `current_datetime` object with the format string `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`. This format string represents the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second components of the datetime object. The formatted datetime string is then printed
Certainly! Here are the responses to the remaining questions:

Q66. A comment in Python is a line of text that is not executed as part of the program but provides additional information or explanation. Comments are used to make the code more readable, document its functionality, or leave notes for other programmers. Python supports two types of comments:

- Single-line comments: These comments start with a hash character `#` and extend until the end of the line. Anything after the `#` is considered a comment. For example:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
```

- Multi-line comments: Python does not have a built-in syntax for multi-line comments like some other programming languages. However, you can achieve multi-line comments by using triple quotes `'''` or `"""` to enclose multiple lines of text. Although the text within triple quotes is not executed, it is treated as a string literal and can be accessed through docstrings. For example:

```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans across multiple lines.
'''
```

Q67. The `input()` function in Python is used to read input from the user through the console. It displays a prompt (optional) and waits for the user to enter a value, which is then returned as a string. Here's an example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

In the above code, the `input()` function prompts the user to enter their name. The value entered by the user is stored in the `name` variable as a string. The program then prints a greeting message using the entered name.

Q68. The `split()` method in Python is used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. By default, the delimiter is a space. Here's an example:

```python
sentence = "Hello, how are you?"
words = sentence.split()
print(words)
```

In the above code, the `split()` method is called on the `sentence` string. Since no delimiter is specified, the string is split into substrings at each space character. The resulting substrings are stored in the `words` list, which is then printed. The output will be:

```
['Hello,', 'how', 'are', 'you?']
```

Q69. To concatenate strings in Python, you can use the concatenation operator `+` or the `join()` method. Here's an example using both approaches:

```python
# Using the concatenation operator
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)

# Using the join() method
words = ["Hello", "world!"]
sentence = " ".join(words)
print(sentence)
```

In the above code, the concatenation operator `+` is used to concatenate the `first_name`, a space character, and the `last_name` to form the `full_name` string. The `join()` method is used to concatenate the elements of the `words` list with a space character in between to form the `sentence` string. Both resulting strings are then printed.

Q70. To convert a string to lowercase or uppercase in Python, you can use the `lower()` and `upper()` methods, respectively. Here's an example:

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
lower_text = text.lower()
upper_text = text.upper()
print(lower_text)
print(upper_text)
```

Q71. The `format()` method in Python is used to format strings by replacing placeholders with values. It allows you to create dynamic strings with variables, numbers, and other data types. Here's an example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
greeting = "Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age)
print(greeting)
```

In the above code, the `format()` method is called on the `greeting` string. The curly braces `{}` serve as placeholders for the variables `name` and `age`. The values of `name` and `age` are then passed to the `format()` method as arguments, and they replace the respective placeholders in the string. The formatted string is stored in the `greeting` variable and printed.

Q72. The `append()` method in Python is used to add an item to the end of a list. It modifies the list in-place by adding the specified element as the last item. Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)
```

In the above code, the `append()` method is called on the `fruits` list with the argument `"orange"`. This adds the string `"orange"` as the last item in the list. The modified list is then printed, showing `["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange"]`.

Q73. The `remove()` method in Python is used to remove the first occurrence of a specified element from a list. It modifies the list in-place by removing the specified element if it exists. Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana"]
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)
```

In the above code, the `remove()` method is called on the `fruits` list with the argument `"banana"`. This removes the first occurrence of `"banana"` from the list. The modified list is then printed, showing `["apple", "cherry", "banana"]`.

Q74. The `pop()` method in Python is used to remove and return an element from a list at a specified index. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last element. Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
removed_fruit = fruits.pop(1)
print(removed_fruit)
print(fruits)
```

In the above code, the `pop()` method is called on the `fruits` list with the argument `1`. This removes and returns the element at index `1`, which is `"banana"`. The removed fruit is stored in the `removed_fruit` variable and printed. The modified list is then printed, showing `["apple", "cherry"]`.

Q75. The `index()` method
In the above code, the `lower()` method is called on the `text` string to convert it to lowercase, and the result is stored in the `lower_text` variable. Similarly, the
